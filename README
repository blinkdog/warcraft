This repository contains three AddOns for World of Warcraft that I wrote
over the past three years. Nothing terribly glamorous, but they helped
me learn a little bit of Lua, a little bit of WoW, and occupied my time.

healersays - An AddOn that automatically informs the party when you
             are running low on mana. The interesting thing is that
             it waits until combat is complete; thereby making the
             message more likely to be read.

             It also sends a Whisper to the tank, because this produces
             a "ding" under the default UI that is more likely to catch
             the attention of the tank.

             It also sends a whisper to Warlocks telling them to convert
             health to mana. Some healers are jerks, won't heal warlocks
             who self-hurt; this was intended to dispell this fear.

             It also whispers the tank to say "Tell me if the DPS give
             you any trouble." The most common problem I saw in WoW,
             especially at low levels, were bad DPS who pulled in front
             of the tank. Letting the tank know that you'll help on a
             Vote to Kick is always a nice gesture.

needmonitor - When you are leveling your very first main, it can be
              extremely frustrating to watch people select Need on an
              item they can't even use.

              In modern versions of WoW, selecting Need automatically
              makes the item Soulbound, which helps a lot. Although it
              still doesn't prevent the ultra-greedy from trying to
              acquire items just for vendor junk.

              Once I got my first main up to maximum level, this AddOn
              looks almost silly in hindsight. Really? An AddOn to
              complain about someone Need-ing on a Lvl 40 piece of gear?
              But, anyway, it gave me peace of mind, because it watched
              for ninjas so that I didn't have to.

              Status: Total mess, needs work if you want to use it

polyglot - This is an interesting one, intended more for RP servers. The
           idea is that your character can learn to understand the
           languages of other races. It depends on others running the
           AddOn to provide translations, so it's best when everyone in
           your guild is running it, etc.

I don't anticipate playing World of Warcraft again in the future. So,
